GlPortal is a modern free and open shader based 3d game and game engine with realistic physic simulation. It runs on all modern operating systems including GNU/Linux, Mac and Windows.

## It is playable
We always try to get a working prototype released so that you can keep track of our progress and can use the client to test the new features and your maps.

## It is evolving
GlPortal is a big open source project and it is still growing. So expect more content and gameplay as we keep developing GlPortal over the years.

## It is hackable
You can extend GlPortals functionality with JavaScript. Many of GlPortals features are configurable with json. All tools you need for this are open source.
