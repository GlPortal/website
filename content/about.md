# It is playable
We always try to get a working prototype released so that you can keep track of our progress and can use the client to test the new features and your maps.

# It runs on your computer
GlPortal runs on all mayor platforms and we love to help you get GlPortal to run on your machine.

# It is evolving
GlPortal is a big open source project and it is still growing. So expect more content and gameplay as we keep developing GlPortal over the years.
