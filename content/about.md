GlPortal is a modern free and open 3d game and game engine with physic simulation. It runs on all modern operating systems including GNU/Linux, Mac and Windows.

## Playable
We always try to get a working prototype released so that you can keep track of our progress and can use the client to test the new features and your maps.
